README

The following test suite runs on a appium server with python3-selenium bindings. This will have to be set up on your local port before the test can be run.

Things that must be changed before first run:
1) You must download and move the MOV-PA ipa (simulator version) and the movCreds.txt text file to secure locations on your local testing computer
2) line 18 of confTest.py must be changed to the proper path for the IPA of the app you are testing
3) Line 13 of var.py mush be changed to the proper path for the movCreds.txt file

To run all tests:
- enter test directory that all test files are in, and type "python -m unittest discover" into your terminal

To run individual test files:
- enter test directory that all test files are in, and type "python [name-of-test-file]" into your terminal

To have live printout: switch runner method to second option [#unittest.main(warnings='ignore')]
to have HTML test printout: switch runner method to first option [unittest.main(warnings='ignore', testRunner=HtmlTestRunner.HTMLTestRunner(output='<html_report_dir>')]
